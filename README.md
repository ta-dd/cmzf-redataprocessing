## Project summary

This project aims to automate scraping data from [sreality](https://www.sreality.cz/) using its public [API](https://www.sreality.cz/api/cs/v2/estates?).
We are still developing a package which user can install and use as he needs. Tutoarial can be found in this file (Exploring our package.ipynb)?
We also provide an exemplary EDA which we performaned on flats for sale downloaded using our source code. Can be found in this folder ...  with SQLite containing our code.

Note: we performed EDA before finishing our package so we could cache the details and fix it.
